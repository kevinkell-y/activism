                <!-- <h3>TAKE ACTION TO END FLUORIDATION!</h2> -->
                <p>Ending fluoridation is as easy as turning off the spigot at your local water works, but to turn off that spigot requires political will. This is not easy without the help of the mainstream media, but it can be done and we are doing it. Since 1990, over 400 communities in the United States and Canada — representing millions of people — have ended the practice of water fluoridation in their communities.

                To  build upon this momentum, we have set forth seven ways you can help end water fluoridation. To be an effective advocate, however, you will need to learn as much as you can about the fluoride issue. Thankfully, FAN’s website will allow you to do just that.

                Ending water fluoridation is not a pipe dream. It can happen, and it can happen soon — but only if people take it upon themselves to organize and make it a reality. Take a moment, therefore, to read about the seven ways you can help. Then ask yourself the question: what role would you like to play?</p>

                        <li>Join FAN’s Movement!</li>
                        <p>FAN is a vibrant movement of concerned individuals throughout the United States, Canada, and the world. There are many ways you can join this movement, from signing up for our free newsletter, joining us on Facebook and Twitter, to volunteering to become a FAN regional contact, to signing our online petitions to governments and corporations.</p>

                        <li>Equip Yourself with FAN’s Activist Tool-Kit.</li>
                        <p>Help spread the word about fluoride by using the professionally designed materials in FAN’s Activist Tool Kit, including brochures, flyers, DVDs, bumper stickers, yard signs, and more.</p>

                        <li>Start a Local Campaign.</li>
                        <p>FAN members have had the greatest level of success stopping fluoridation on the local level. Even if your town is not fluoridated, there are other local initiatives that can help raise awareness about the fluoride problem. For tips on how to start a successful local campaign, click here.</p>

                        <li>Start a Statewide Campaign.</li>
                        <p>After you’ve defeated fluoridation in your community, join forces with other fluoride groups in the state and take the campaign statewide. Click here for tips on how to do so.</p>

                        <li>Take National Action.</li>
                        <p>In the United States, we have the regrettable situation that not one federal agency is acting responsibly to protect the public from the risks of fluoride exposure. To learn more the failures of these agencies, and what can be done to bring about change, click here.</p>

                        <li>Take International Action.</li>
                        <p>FAN is in regular contact with local and national groups fighting fluoridation in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand and the UK. You can help the efforts in these countries by putting friends and families in these areas in contact with FAN organizers. You can also help by asking any health professionals you know to sign the Professional Statement to End Water Fluoridation. Click here for more info.</p>

                        <li>Donate to FAN.</li>
                        <p>FAN relies almost entirely on individual donors — rather than foundations or governments — to fund our work. If you support FAN’s work, therefore, please consider making a tax-deductible donation today.</p>
